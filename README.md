# üåü Portfolio
## A lightweight portfolio for all my projects

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jupanaos/portfolio.git
   ```
2. Install required packages with node
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## About

I used Next.js with SSG to benefit from its SEO and speed performances.
